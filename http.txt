HTTP1.1

-- It keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.
-- It loads resources one after the other
-- slower compared to HTTP2
-- It blocks all other resources behind it
-- Headers are sent on every request leading to a lot of duplicate data being sent uncompressed across the wire.


HTTP2

-- It uses binary format
-- It sends multiple steams data  at once
-- faster in terms of performance and site loading time
-- stream  prioritization is also possible while sending multiple data items
-- Header compression is included by default in HTTP/2 using HPACK.
